# Vegetarian Pad Thai 

Every Thai food fan would know what Pad Thai is, and even would have tried it! This noodle recipe is delicious with healthy stir fry tofu and veggies. Traditionally it is made with eggs, fish or meat but this meal is easy to veganize too. I have added colorful vegetables such as green and red bell pepper, carrots, broccoli, sprouts and stir fry tofu which makes dish protein and fiber rich.  So, I thought sharing this easy and healthy recipe with all of you!
